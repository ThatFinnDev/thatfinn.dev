      SR2E
  </a></strong></h1>
  <p>
    SR2E, short for SR2Essentials, is a mod for the popular game 
    <a href="https://www.slimerancher.com/" target="_blank">Slime Rancher 2</a>
    by 
    <a href="http://www.monomipark.com/" target="_blank">Monomi Park</a>.
    The mod requires 
    <a href="https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader" target="_blank">MelonLoader</a>
    to work. The mod adds lots of things to the main game, like a console, a mod menu, 
    a cheat menu and bunch of other cool things! This mod is not affiliated with 
    <a href="http://www.monomipark.com/" target="_blank">Monomi Park</a>.

    <a class="remove-text-color" href="https://github.com/ThatFinnDev/AA-Reboot" target="_blank">AA-Reboot</a> is a very simple homebrew for a modded Switch console. It just reboots to payload. I originally made it, because I was to lazy
    to press "-" when opening the original app. Also, since it starts with "AA-", it's pretty likely to be the first entry,
    when staring the homebrew. It makes rebooting to payload faster. Instead of the normal atmosphere one, it looks for
    hekate.bin on the root of your sd card (if you want a custom payload) and if there is non, it reboots into hekate if
    installed. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/ThatFinnDev/AA-Reboot" target="_blank">AA-Reboot</a> 
    has an extension called 
    <a href="https://github.com/ThatFinnDev/AA-Reboot-APPLET" target="_blank">AA-Reboot-APPLET</a> 
    which as the name suggest is an applet forwarder. It replaces the Nintendo Switch Online applet on the home screen.
    In this scenario, if you have only one account (a linked one) on your Switch, and direct game starting is activated,
    you only need to press home and double tap on the icon to enter hekate.
